CS 380D distributed system project 1

Name: Qi Huang, Tong Gao, Xiaoyang Shen
UT EIDs: qh2466
UTCS ids: qhuang

Description of our protocol: \TODO Xiaoyang Shen

Description of our tests: \TODO Tong Gao

Instruction on how to use our system:

1) put all the test commands in a txt file TEST.txt, each command separate by newline

2) python master TEST.txt

Other information:

This is a single-thread implementation of Chandy-Lampart algorithm. We model channels as deque accessible by both receivers and senders of any specific channel. We model Master, Observer and Member
nodes as instances of their respective classes. All the communication about the data in transaction, and the initialization, propogation and report stage of the distributed snapshot algorithm 
are performed by message-passing in this channel framework.

Per discussion with Professor in the office hour, when master node notify member node to send/recv messages, we use MemberNode.send() or MmeberNode.recv() due to the sigle-thread nature of this
implementation.
