*************************
1. Implementation Details
*************************

This is a single-thread implementation of Chandy-Lampart algorithm in Python3. 
We model channels as deque accessible by both receivers and senders of any specific channel. 
We model Master, Observer and (Member) Nodes as instances of their respective classes. Master
orders the observer and nodes by calling their methods directly, but the observer and nodes only
use their connecting channels for communication about the data in transaction, state initialization,
propogation and reporting stage of the distributed snapshot algorithm.

Per discussion with the professor in the office hour, when master node notify member node to send/recv
messages, we use MemberNode.send() or MmeberNode.recv() due to the sigle-thread nature of this
implementation.

3. Usage Instructions
*********************

The system assumes that the user has Python3 executable located at /usr/bin/python.
No extra packages are required.

1) put all the test commands in a txt file TEST.txt, each command separated by newline

2) ./master TEST.txt
